## Go Instrumentation

Specifically for Go applications, OBI chooses to instrument libraries directly using Uprobes, instead of instrumenting
at the network level. This allows for more accurate tracing and context propagation.
This set of instrumentations currently replaces all the network level instrumentation for Go applications.
To turn this off and fallback to the normal network based instrumentation for Go processes, you set
`discovery.skip_go_specific_tracers` to `true` in the config, or set the environment variable
`OTEL_EBPF_SKIP_GO_SPECIFIC_TRACERS=true`.

## GPU Instrumentation

Specifically for instrumenting GPU execution primitives, like NVIDIA CUDA kernel launches and memory copies. This
instrumentation support differs from traditional GPU metrics, such as GPU utilization and GPU temperature.

# Supported Context propagation frameworks

For Inter-process context propagation, OBI by default assumes actions happening the same thread are part of the same
trace.
but in many cases, especially in asynchronous programming models, the context might be propagated across threads or even
processes.
OBI has support for several asynchronous frameworks that allow it to propagate context in these scenarios.
